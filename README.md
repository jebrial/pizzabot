# pizzabot

Just a little playground for some things: Hardware, Twilio, and Node.js

I got the messaging wired up to actually send texts at the press of a button. The "pizza api" doesnt seem to work but I could probably replace that or fork it and fix it. 

This was part of a NodeBots Day at meetup.com HQ: http://www.meetup.com/nodebots/events/232570808/
